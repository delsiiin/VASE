{"pred": "In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have unearthed a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers from northeastern China that lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. The dinosaur, named Caihong, had iridescent feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, with colors that shimmered and shifted in the light, like those of hummingbirds. The discovery suggests a more colorful Jurassic World than previously imagined. The scientists detected within the feathers the remnants of organelles called melanosomes responsible for pigmentation. The team couldn't reconstruct the dinosaur feathers' exact colors, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer. The discovery of Caihong is the earliest-known creature with asymmetrical feathers, a trait used by birds to steer when flying. The dinosaur had crests above its eyes that looked like bony eyebrows, and many dinosaurs possessed feathers. Birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs near the end of the Jurassic Period. Caihong had fuzzy feathers and pennaceous ones, those that look like writing quills. It is the oldest-known animal to have this key adaptation of asymmetrical feathers. The discovery of Caihong may not have stopped there, as its plumage was a shiny rainbow of iridescent colors, and it also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which was probably a display structure as well. The discovery of Caihong may also provide insights into the functions of the iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person. The Bachelor started filming in September, and it's unclear if Martinez was still filming when she was reported missing. She tweets \"the scariest thing\" about being a missing person \"is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4630}

However, Senate Democrats have said they will reject any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has moved to delay the health law in order to satisfy conservatives in his party, and Republicans believe there is some chance that the Senate will agree to repeal the medical device tax. If the House eventually accepts a spending bill with no major changes to the health law, Republicans will be unlikely to do so until the last minute, and a short government shutdown may have to take place to satisfy conservatives' desire to show they fought as much as they could. The Senate has not yet acted on the House's proposal, but Democrats could receive the bill and table the amendments to delay the health law and to repeal the medical device tax. Aides do not expect there to be an opportunity for delaying tactics such as a filibuster, but if an opening arises, one lawmaker who has already shown an inclination to use delaying tactics on the Washington region, where the federal government's presence accounts for one-third of the economy, could use it. In 1995 and 1996, when a political impasse between President Bill Clinton and a Republican-controlled House led to the shutdown of the federal government for three weeks, several appropriations bills had already passed, but this time, not a single appropriations bill has made it through Congress, so a shutdown could affect every federal agency in some way. The ripple effects of a shutdown can be devastating, and lawmakers are concerned about how it could affect the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, the U.S. Marshals Service and other agencies, many of whose employees live in the area.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, formerly known as the Solar Probe Plus mission, will now be known as the Parker Solar Probe, honouring the American solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker who predicted a high speed solar wind – the stream of charged particles, or plasma, that flows from the sun out into space. Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, put forward his theory in 1958. The mission will attempt to get close to the sun's surface and will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The spacecraft will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun. It will then repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. The 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The latest notice said that \"some of our customers’ payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at our stores.\" The company apologized again, and said it did not believe the customers’ Social Security numbers or birth dates — key pieces of personal data — had been compromised. Neiman Marcus defended its decision not to disclose anything until last week, saying it waited to confirm evidence. The company said nothing about when the attack began and when it was contained. In a call with credit card companies on Monday, Neiman Marcus acknowledged that the attack had only been fully contained a day earlier, and that the time stamp on the first intrusion was in mid-July.

All eyes have been on North Korea following the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon on Sunday, which was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, according to nuclear experts. North Korean state media claimed that the country detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM.

The study was published online Jan. 25 in the journal Cancer.

For patients under 50, about 68 percent survived five years, while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "In this news, a Russian astronomer named Nikolai Kardashev proposed a model in 1962 to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. He divided societies into three types based on their energy consumption: Type I, II, and III. Type I societies harvest all the resources of a planet, Type II societies harvest all the energy of a star, and Type III societies harvest all the energy of a galaxy. A new study by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist. According to Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources, but it's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. Any advanced civilization worth their starships would understand the grim reality of universal expansion and would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in and harvest their energy first, before those stars (and their energy) became inaccessible forever. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described similar structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" where alien civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. Physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960, where really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "In three newly published papers in the journal Science, researchers have made significant discoveries about the behavior changes of members of the Homo genus in response to climate shifts in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. The discoveries include the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, which were likely used for trading networks and long-distance contacts among hominid populations. The researchers also found evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials, including obsidian and bright red ochre pigment, which were used to color rocks. The findings suggest that Homo sapiens and their precursors responded to changing landscapes by foraging over larger areas with smaller tools, and that the transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species was evolving across the continent. The researchers also note that the association between Early and Middle Stone Age and pre- and fully-modern human fossils remains complex and confusing, and that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was, as archaeological evidence for modern behaviors arose much earlier.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Without help he is still about 90% deaf, but, when using hearing aids, he could \"hear the wind blow and the birds tweet\". Kieran struggled at his first school because he looked different to the other children.

Israel has responded with air strikes on Gaza, and political sources say the government has decided to more than double the current reserve troop quota set for the Gaza offensive. Egypt's prime minister has denounced what he described as Israeli aggression and said Cairo was prepared to mediate a truce.

In other recent conflicts, Israel has intensely shelled suspected militant positions to soften resistance ahead of ground invasions, but the shelling in this assault has been more limited.

The ocean, which was a mile deep in some places, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. The discovery adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes. The researchers used three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world to study Mars' atmosphere over six years and found that the ordinary hydrogen in water has been gradually leaking into outer space. The team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, took a series of measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The hydrogen in water, whether it's on Mars or on Earth, comes in two varieties: ordinary hydrogen, whose nuclei contain just a proton, and \"heavy\" hydrogen, also known as deuterium, with a proton and a neutron. The team found that Mars now has a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth does—seven times as high, in fact. The scientists also found that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers today in the Martian atmosphere. The team led by Michael Mumma, a senior scientist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, used the Keck II telescope and Nasa’s Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. The team found that the Martian atmosphere has a strong isotopic anomaly and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The first step is to sign the ticket, as it is essential to prevent roommates, significant others, or anyone else from claiming it. The next step is to take a selfie with the ticket and store it in a safe place, such as a safe deposit box or a portable home safe. It is also advisable to contact experienced professionals, such as an attorney and a certified financial planner, to help make important decisions about the prize money.\n\nThe jackpot has reached a record-breaking $586 million, with a lump sum cash option of $316 million. The odds of winning the jackpot are mounting, and ticket sales are expected to increase before the drawing on Tuesday, December 18, 2018.
